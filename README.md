## Overview
**Subwaste Surfer** is an endless runner-style 3D game with an environmental message, developed for the SHPE UF's Code for Change 2025 Hackathon. The player controls WALL-E as he navigates through an underwater environment filled with waste and pollution, collecting recyclable items and avoiding obstacles.

The game aims to raise awareness about ocean pollution while providing an engaging gameplay experience. As players progress, they earn points by collecting items and navigating through increasingly challenging environments.

## Project Background
This project was developed for the **Environmental Track** of **Code for Change 2025**, a 24-hour hackathon organized by SHPE UF. The mission of this event is to empower students to foster positive community change using creative software and design solutions.

As ocean pollution continues to be a major environmental concern, our project seeks to:
- Raise awareness about ocean waste and its impact on marine ecosystems
- Demonstrate the importance of recycling and proper waste management
- Engage users through interactive gameplay to promote environmental responsibility

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Git (to clone the repository)
- Python 3 (for running a local web server)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kgand/code-for-change-2025.git
   cd code-for-change-2025
   ```

2. **Download Three.js:**
   - Download Three.js development version from: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/
   - Extract and place the `three.js-dev` folder in the root directory of the project
   - Ensure the path structure is correct: `code-for-change-2025/three.js-dev/`

3. **Start a local web server:**
   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

4. **Access the game:**
