# Game Sounds

This directory will contain all the sound assets for the Subwaste Surfer game.

## Planned Sound Effects

- `jump.mp3`: Sound when Wall-E jumps
- `collect.mp3`: Sound when collecting waste items
- `crash.mp3`: Sound when hitting an obstacle
- `game-over.mp3`: Sound when the game ends
- `background-music.mp3`: Background music for the game

Sound effects will be environmentally themed, with mechanical Wall-E sounds and recycling/waste collection audio cues.
